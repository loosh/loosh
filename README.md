### Hi there 👋

I'm Lucian (loosh-in). I've been programming since I was 16 and have experience creating efficient and scalable systems in fast-paced and competitive environments. I started out scripting and writing Discord bots / browser extensions, and eventually grew passionate for full-stack development, with experience serverside as well as on web / mobile / desktop applications. I've also recently grown interested in machine learning and AI, and recently won a reinforcement learning competition at my university.
